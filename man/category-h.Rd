\title{Primitive Category H}
\description{
The primitive category H is defined as:
- Objects: stock, flow, link
- Morphisms:
  - u: flow → stock (upstream/source)
  - d: flow → stock (downstream/target)
  - s: link → stock/variable (source)
  - t: link → flow (target)
}
\details{
A stock-flow diagram is a functor F: H → FinSet that maps:
- F(stock) = set of stock IDs
- F(flow) = set of flow IDs
- F(link) = set of link IDs
- F(u) = function mapping flows to source stocks
- F(d) = function mapping flows to target stocks
- F(s) = function mapping links to source stocks/variables
- F(t) = function mapping links to target flows
}
