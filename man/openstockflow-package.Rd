\title{openstockflow: Categorical Stock-Flow Modeling with Compositional Diagrams}
\description{
Implements categorical stock-flow modeling using decorated cospans and functorial semantics. Enables compositional model building where complex systems are assembled from simpler components through categorical operations. Supports stratification via pullbacks (e.g., by age, sex, risk group), ODE generation, and integration with tidyverse/tidygraph ecosystem. Based on the mathematical framework described in Baez et al. (2022).
