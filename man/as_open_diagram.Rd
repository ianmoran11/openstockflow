\usage{
as_open_diagram(
  diagram,
  left_interface = character(0),
  right_interface = character(0)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{diagram}{StockFlowDiagram object}

\item{left_interface}{Character vector of stock names for left foot}

\item{right_interface}{Character vector of stock names for right foot}
}
\value{
OpenStockFlowDiagram object
}
\description{
Creates an open diagram by specifying which stocks are exposed as interfaces.
Open diagrams can be composed via the compose() function.
}
\details{
An open diagram is represented as a decorated cospan:
```
     left_leg        right_leg
I -----------> Apex <----------- O
```

The left and right feet specify which stocks are exposed for composition.
Identity morphisms are created as legs (feet stocks map to themselves in apex).

# Expose I as right interface for composition
