\title{Decorated Cospan}
\description{
Represents a decorated cospan: L ← A → R where A is the apex diagram
and L, R are the feet (interfaces). Used for categorical composition.
}
\details{
A decorated cospan represents an "open" diagram with exposed interfaces.
The legs are morphisms (injective functions) from the feet to the apex.
Composition is achieved by computing pushouts.
