\title{Connect stocks via flows using algebraic notation}
\usage{
lhs \%->\% rhs
}
\arguments{
\item{lhs}{Left-hand side: stock_spec or flow_spec (or NULL for external inflow)}

\item{rhs}{Right-hand side: flow_spec or stock_spec (or NULL for external outflow)}
}
\value{
A partial or complete flow connection
}
\description{
The %->% operator creates a flow connection between two stocks.
It can be chained: stock1 %->% flow1 %->% stock2
}
\details{
As of version 0.2.0, stocks referenced in flow connections are automatically
included in the diagram when finalize() is called, eliminating the need to
explicitly add them with %+%. This makes the API more concise while remaining
fully backward compatible.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Define stocks
S <- stock("S", initial = 1000)
I <- stock("I", initial = 1)

# Define flow
infection <- flow("infection",
  rate = function(inputs, params) params$beta * inputs$S * inputs$I
)

# Connect: S \%->\% infection \%->\% I
connection <- S \%->\% infection \%->\% I

# Stocks are automatically included when finalized
diagram <- finalize(connection)  # S and I automatically added!

# External flows use NULL
inflow <- NULL \%->\% some_flow \%->\% Stock
outflow <- Stock \%->\% some_flow \%->\% NULL
}
