\title{Flow (thick arrow in stock-flow diagrams)}
\description{
Represents a flow between stocks. Flows are depicted as thick arrows and
represent rates of change. A flow can have a source stock (upstream),
a target stock (downstream), both, or neither (for inflows/outflows).
}
\details{
The rate_function should have signature: function(inputs, params)
where inputs is a named list of values and params is a named vector
of parameters. It should return a single numeric value.
